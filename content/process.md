# Process for Clickbank Analysis Tool

Clickbank is "the" platform for English information products. The platform allows you to download product data from their website. This is interesting for data analysis tool to find products.
Therefore I want to follow the process of finding my own affiliate products with the tool I am developing along the way. I am a novice. As a novice you have many problems gurus forget to mention in their material. It's important to find those problems while following the process.

I am writing a simple how-to-manual as a lead magnet for the website, to collect email addresses. The data analysis tool I publish as early as possible. 

What is important:

- Not to fall into "Just development/data analysis trap".
- "marketing-first" is my approach
- Being laser-focused on what matters to earn money
- Collecting Emails a early as possible
